          > Hey, I'm sch3fr. I am a 22 year old computer science student <i>based</i> 
          in Czechia. I'm currently attending the bachelors program at the Czech University 
          of Life Sciences in Prague. At the moment I'm developing desktop applications 
          in <b>C#</b>, microcontroller firmware in <b>C</b>, and sometimes I do a little 
          <b>HTML</b> project with pure <b>CSS</b>, because I like to hit the ground running.
          Oh, and did I mention that I use <b>Git</b> and can work with databases using 
          <b>SQL</b>?
          <br><br>
          > I'm finishing the bachelors study programme soon. To make my life more intersting, 
          I recently learned <b>LaTeX</b> and used it to write my bachelor's thesis with. I hope 
          I have what it takes to eventually enroll in engineering program. I guess that 
          depends on how good my paper on <b>AI</b> is gonna be.
          <br><br>
          > Outside of computer sciency stuff I'm interested in film photography and 
          sci-fi literature, though I do spend a lot of time tinkering with my <b>3D printer</b>, 
          wide collection of <b>Arduinos</b> and <b>Raspberry Pis</b>, or simply tweaking 
          my <b>Linux</b> installation. And wether or not I built my own computer should 
          not even be a question.
          <br><br>

            <h3>SmolBoatRemiXD</h3>
            <p>SmolBoat is a custom 3D printed mechanical keyboard designed by Druz320 on Thingiverse. 
              While I really liked the design, there were some tweaks that I wanted to make, and I also 
              needed smaller models, so I could print it on my smaller 3D printer.</p>
