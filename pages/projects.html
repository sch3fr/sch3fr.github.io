      <h2>deSnap GTA Tool</h2>
    </a>
    <p>This is a beautiful example of creating a solution for a real problem, not coding for the sake of it. deSnap is a tool for extracting pictures from 
      the Snapmatic feature in Grand Theft Auto Online. The images are stored on a drive, but in binary unopenable file. This tool strips the binary 
      of useless header data and exports the images to the desktop. Simple as that. And the code is beautiful with less than 50 lines. Read more 
      <a href="../pages/Projects/desnap.html">here</a> or on <a href="https://github.com/sch3fr/deSnap">Github</a>

      <h2>Interface design assignment</h2>
    </a>
      <p>This is a project I worked on for my Human-computer Interactions class. The assignment was to design an interface for an app of my choice.
        I chose to design a phone app for tracking meals during the day. The user can record photos of food, number of calories and date and time of dinner.
        Eventually I'd like to make a working prototype of this app. More info can be found <a href="../pages/Projects/design.html">here</a>.

      <h2>Mastermind C# console game</h2>
    </a>
      <p>This is the first "real" program I ever created. It was an assignment for my first programming class. Everybody had to do one, but the topics
        were chosen in a draw. I got the Mastermind game. The requirements were as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Program on topic</li>
        <li>No random crashes</li>
        <li>No "magic" variables</li>
        <li>Absolutely no spahgetti</li>
        <li>The abilty to export and import data</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can view more info either <a href="../pages/Projects/mastermind.html">here</a> or on <a href="https://github.com/sch3fr/mastermind">Github</a></p>

      <h2>SmolBoatRemiXD firmware</h2>
    </a>
    <p>This is my weekend project that took me about 6 days to finish, it was harder than it looked. I found a cool looking 
      custom keyboard on Thingiverse, but there was no wiring diagram, no firmware, and some things I didn't like about the .STLs. 
      So I took it upon myself to fix all of those things. As always, you can find more about it either <a href="../pages/Projects/smolobat.html">here</a> 
      or on <a href="https://github.com/sch3fr/SmolBoatRemiXD">Github</a>
