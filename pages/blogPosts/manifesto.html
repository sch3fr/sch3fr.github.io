      <h2>Computing Rules for the Near Future - a manifesto</h2>
      <p>10.08.2025</p>
      <p>Let's face it. The tech is becoming worse. Our solarpunk future is dying, cyberpunk dystopia is here and it's 
        probably gonna stay for some time. With data leaks happening almost every other day and the privacy and anonymity
        of the internet slowly disappearing, I thought we should engineer our own future. One that is human oriented again.
        So here is my manifesto. My list of computing rules for the next decade. All the things I do are gonna be 
        affected by the rules laid out here. Please note that I might add some rule every now and then. This has been on 
        my mind for way too long, and my brain fog I've been dealing with lately is not making things any easier. Never 
        mind the preface, here we go.
      </p>
      <h3>1. Knowledge should not be locked behind memberships or paywalls</h3>
      <p>We all saw it, it happened already. With the massive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit_API_controversy">
        Reddit API protests</a> the internet became almost unusable. Reddit keeps too much of human knowledge, relying 
        on a single knowledge base is bad for everyone. And don't get me started on every single project having a dedicated
        Discord server. Bad architecture of Discord client aside, the fact that so much knowledge and documentation is 
        stored somewhere without access to wider audience, with next to no indexing, wasting the time of the more knowledgeable
        users on responding the same questions over and over, is horrible. I still can't believe that's where we're at 
        right now.<br><br>
        I call for return of the forums. Small, searchable communities. Not relying on a single service provider, eliminating 
        the blackout point of failure, available in read mode for every internet user. We left the utopia to live in the 
        sewers.
        </p>
      <h3>2. A computer should not make noises, unless asked</h3>
      <p>Absolutely no one is looking for autoplaying thing in the background. While this has gotten much better in the 
        last few years, this should have never been a problem. Autoplaying is bad by itself for users with limited connection,
        autoplay with sound is straight up offensive. I'm not talking only about websites. Parts of public infrastructure 
        just talks. I do not need the whole grocery store to know I'm buying bread at the self checkout. I am making exceptions 
        for accessibility reasons, like when the god forsaken Cortana in Windows 10 talked through the installation. Still 
        annoying, but there's a reason behind that. We should look into some alternatives though.
      </p>
      <h3>3. A computer should not be a blackbox, it should be widely understood how computers work</h3>
      <p>It pains me to say this, but I'm a part of a generation that is bad with computers again. The iPhone brought 
        easy computing to everyone in 2007. And while I'm glad that it did, it also brought the idea of locking down the
        software. It makes me so sad when my peers don't know how navigating folders work. We need to bring back tech
        literacy
      </p>
      <h3>4. Software should be swift, with very fast latency to input</h3>
      <h3>5. Unix philosophy is sacred, and should be widely adopted</h3>
      <h3>6. Self hosting should become a standard in small networks and communities</h3>
      <h3>7. We should empathize content curation and limit algorithmic feeds</h3>
      <h3>8. Users should be capable of deep customization if they want to</h3>
      <h3>9. Hardware should be allowed to work as long as possible</h3>
      <h3>10. Software should be as light as possible to save energy</h3>
      <h3>11. Set standards should never be proprietary</h3>
