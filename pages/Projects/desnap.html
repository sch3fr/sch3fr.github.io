        <h2>deSnap</h2>
        <p>deSnap is a tool for extracting images from the Snapmatic feature in 
          the game GTA Online.
        </p>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The tool finds the correct path itself, no need for user input</li>
          <li>Converts all files at onece</li>
          <li>Light, around 40 lines of code, no extra bloat</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <p>The coded files are located in C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\Rockstar 
          Games\GTA V\Profiles\CODE\<br>
          Username being your user name (duh) and CODE neing a random code named 
          folder insider of the Profiles directory. There are some files we don't 
          care about and the Snapmatic photos, saved as files without any 
          extension, starting with PGTA5, followed by a string of numbers. 
          According to <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/785078-snapmatic-shots/#comment-1067312665">
          this user on gtaforums.com</a> the files are images with 292 bytes of 
          header data. This is verifiable by opening the file in a hex editor 
          and manually deleting the bytes. <br>
          This tool finds its path to the right folder, selects the correct files,
          and one by one it strips each file of the unwanterd bytes. Then it 
          exports all of the pictures to a new folder on desktop. Simple as that. 
          You don't need to manually intervene at any moment.
        </p>
        <h3>What's the current state of the project?</h3>
        <p>The program seems to be working just fine. You can download the first 
          release on my github page. The naming of the output files is kinda 
          wonky though, I might have to change that later. I have yet to test 
          this on any other computer than mine, but as long as you have .NET 6 
          installed on your system it should work without any major problems.
        </p>
        <h3>Usage</h3>
        <p>Could not be any easier. Just download the release, unzip the file 
          and run deSnap.exe! If you don't feel like running random .exe from 
          the internet (I don't blame you), you can always inspect the source 
          code yourself.
        </p>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>I'm really happy with how this turned out. This is the first time I 
          had a real need for a piece of software that I was able to write on 
          my own. I had a problem and I programmed a solution, that is not only 
          made for me, but lots of other GTA Online players might also find it 
          useful. Feels good.<br>
          This project pushed me to learn new things about paths in C#. I'm pretty 
          sure it could be optimized further, but at the moment I'm just happy 
          with how well it works.<br>
