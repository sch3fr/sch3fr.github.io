      <h2>deSnap</h2>
      <p>deSnap is a tool for extracting images from the Snapmatic feature in the game GTA Online.</p>
      <h2>Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The tool finds the correct path itself, no need for input from the user</li>
        <li>Converts all files at once</li>
        <li>Light, around 40 lines of code, no bloat</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>The coded files are located in C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\Rockstar Games\GTA V\Profiles\CODE\<br>
        USERNAME being your user name (duh) and CODE being a random code named folder inside of the Profiles directory.<br>
        There should be some files that we don't care about, and the Snapmatic photos, saved as files without any 
        extension, starting with PGTA5, followed by a string of numbers. According to 
        <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/785078-snapmatic-shots/#comment-1067312665">this user on gtaforums.com</a>
        the files are image files with 292 bytes of header data. This is verifiable by opening the file in a Hex 
        editor and manually deleting the bytes. This tool finds its path to the right folder, selects the correct 
        files, and one by one it strips each file of the unwanted bytes. Then it exports all of the pictures to a 
        new folder on users desktop. Simple as that. You don't need to manually input anything, or look for the 
        right folders.
      </p>
      <h2>What's the current state of the project</h2>
      <p>The program seems to be working fine, you can download the first release on Github. The naming of the 
        output files is kinda wonky, I might have to change that later. I have yet to test it somewhere other than 
        my computer.</p>
      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>It could not be easier. Just download the release, unzip the archive and run deSnap.exe!</p>
      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>I'm really happy with how this turned out. This is the first time I had a real need for a piece of software 
        that I was able to write on my own. I had a problem and I created a solution, that is not only useful for 
        me, lots of people playing GTA Online might find it useful. It feels great.<br>
        This project pushed me to learn new things about paths in C#. I'm pretty sure it could be optimized further, 
        but at the moment I'm just happy with how well it works.</p>
