        <h2>SmolBoatRemiXD</h2>
        <p>SmolBoat is a custom 3D printed mechanical keyboard designed by 
          <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3289175">Druz320 on Thingiverse.</a> 
          While I really liked the design, there were some tweaks that I wanted 
          to make. I also needed smaller models, so I could print it on my 
          small 3D printer. Please note that this firmware is focused only on 
          the JJ50/Preonic clone.</p>

        <h2>Changes compared to the original</h2>
          <ul>  
          <li>Changed the cutout to fit the SparkFun Pro Micro</li>
          <li>Added a hole for controller brace</li>
          <li>Added cherry stabiliser for 2U spacebar</li>
          <li>Added smaller cut files to print on my 3D printer</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>Cuts</h2>
          <p>There are 4 smaller files, two for the bottom and 2 for the top 
            piece. The pieces have hole in the sides for pegs, also included
            in the .STL files, of which you will need 4 of. The pegs help with 
            glueing and overall rugidity of the whole case. As I didn't have 
            any glue suitable for PLA, I used a 3D pen to "weld" the pieces 
            together, which is also a valid option, however make sure to sand 
            down the top piece afterwards, or the switches may not sit fulsh.
        </p>
        <h2>Wiring</h2>
        <p>This is a standard hand wired keyboard. The rows are connected with 
          diodes and the columns are joined together with wire. I may 
          have gotten the wiring confused, so in the following tables you can 
          see the wiring I was going for. If your keyboard does not work 
          properly, you can just change the <i>MATRIX_ROW_PINS</i> and 
          <i>MATRIX_COL_PINS</i>

        <h2>Firmware</h2>
          <p>The firmware is your standard .HEX file compiled using QMK. You can find my .HEX as well as the full source files on my Github page.
            I'd recommend you to write your own keymap, as I used mapping for Czech layout and forgot to add parentheses. Mistakes were made, 
            next version coming soonâ„¢.
          </p>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
          <p>I ended up not using the controller brace piece, since my awful 
            wiring is pushing the Pro Micro to its place<br>
            You might have to file file the Cherry stabs hole a bit for it to fit.<br>
            I'd love to add Vial support sometime in the future.<br>
            The keyboard you can see in the first picture is the finished product, 
            however I am dissatisifed with the top finish from my 3d printer,
            I may have to remake it some time in the future.<br>
