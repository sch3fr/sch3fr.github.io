      <h2>SmolBoatRemiXD</h2>
      <p>SmolBoat is a custom 3D printed mechanical keyboard designed by <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3289175">Druz320 on Thingiverse.</a> 
        While I really liked the design, there were some tweaks that I wanted to make, and I also needed smaller models, so I could print it on my smaller 3D printer. 
        Please note that this firmware is focused only on the JJ50/Preonic clone.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes compared to the original</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Changed the cutout to fit the SparkFun Pro Micro</li>
        <li>Added a hole for controller brace</li>
        <li>Added cherry stabiliser for 2U spacebar</li>
        <li>Added smaller cut files to print on my 3D printer</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Cuts</h2>
      <p>There are 4 smaller files, two for the bottom and 2 for the top piexe. The pieces have hole in the sideds for pegs, also included
        in the .STL files, of which you will need 4 of. The pegs help with gluing and overall rugidity of the whole case. As I didn't have 
        any glue suitable for PLA, I userd a 3D pen to "weld" the pieces together, which is also a valit option, however make suer to sand 
        down the top piece afterwards, or the switches may not sit fulsh.
      </p>
      <h2>Wiring</h2>
      <p>This is a standard hand wired keyboard. The rows are connected with diodes and the columns are joined together with wire. I may 
        have gotten the wiring confused, so in the following tables you can see the wiring I was going for. If your keyboard does not work 
        properly, you can just change the <i>MATRIX_ROW_PINS</i> and <i>MATRIX_COL_PINS</i> <a href="https://github.com/sch3fr/SmolBoatRemiXD/blob/main/firmware/config.h">in the config.h</a> 
        file and recompile it using QMK.

      <h2>Firmware</h2>
      <p>The firmware is your standard .HEX file compiled in QMK. You can find my .HEX as well as the full source files on my Github page.
        I'd recommend you to write your own keymap, as I used mapping for Czech layout and forgot to add parentheses, whoops, next version 
        coming soonâ„¢.
      </p>
      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I ended up not using the controller brace piece, since my awful wiring is pushing the Pro Micro to its place</li>
        <li>You might have to file file the Cherry stabs hole a bit for it to fit.</li>
        <li>I'd love to add Vial support sometime in the future.</li>
