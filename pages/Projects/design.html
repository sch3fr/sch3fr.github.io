          <a id="motivation"><h3>Motivation</h3></a>
          <p>The motivation for this work is to create a design for an application that will help people 
          pay attention to what and how much they eat. The idea is based on a quote from Peter Drucker - 
          <i>What gets measured gets managed.</i> <br>
          The Hungie app is therfore used to monitor calories and record meals. The app can function
          eaither as a tool to improve onse lifestyle or as a simple food diary.</p>
        </section>

            <a id="goals"><h3>Goals</h3></a>
            <p>The goal is to design the front end of a simple app for recording meals. The application 
              should be as clear as possible so the user will not get discouraged from making regular
              entries. If everything takes too long, the user will lose interest.<br>
              Long story short, the main points of this design are:<br>
              <ul>
                <li>Create a design for a food diary app</li>
                <li>Provide users with a tool to quickly record meals and allow users to deal with the details later</li>
                <li>Let the users specify the location of the entry on the map</li>
                <li>Give the users the opportunity to remember the good foods of the past</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
